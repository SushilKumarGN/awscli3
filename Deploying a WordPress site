Deploying a WordPress site over AWS using RDS

1) Webserver configured on EC2 Instance 
2) Document Root(/var/www/html) made persistent by mounting on EBS Block Device. 
3) Static objects used in code such as pictures stored in S3 
4) Setting up Content Delivery Network using CloudFront and using the origin domain as S3 bucket. 
5) Finally place the Cloud Front URL on the webapp code for security and low latency.

To configure WordPress site, we will create the following resources in AWS: 

1) An Amazon RDS for MySQL database to store your WordPress data. 
2) An Amazon EC2 instance to install and host the WordPress application. 

Launching MySQL Providing  

1) Master Username  
2) Password  
3) Initial Database name 

Launching EC2 Instances.(with basic configurations)

To run WordPress on any machine, we’ll need to install Apache, PHP, and MySQL.
commands are:-
> yum install httpd
> yum install php php-mysqlnd mysql -y

Then go inside document root, /var/www/html and download the WordPress file and unzip it.

> yum install wget
> wget https://wordpress.org/latest.tar.gz
> tar -xf latest.tar.gz

At last, start the httpd service and make it permanent: 
> systemctl start httpd
> systemctl enable httpd

Now, we can login to our database through EC2 instance using the command: 
> mysql -h <endpoint> -u <username> -p 

Enter the IP address of your ec2-instance in your browser to open the WordPress configuration menu by entering initial database name, username, password and DNS endpoint of the database.

Now it’s time for the fun part — go play with your new site. Configure the design, add pages and posts, and start getting users to your site.
